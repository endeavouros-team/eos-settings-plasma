# eos-settings-plasma

This repo holds the EndeavourOS customization for plasma.

This consists of two items:
* A lightly customized version of Breeze Dark
* A kdeglobals file which sets this theme as the default for new user accounts

The primary purpose of this is to eliminate the unused discover icon on the panel.
