[![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2024.svg)]()

This repo holds the EndeavourOS customization for plasma.

This consists of 3 items:
* A lightly customized version of Breeze Dark
* A kdeglobals file which sets this theme as the default for new user accounts
* A mimeapps.list that sets haruna (video player) as default to play video common files

The primary purpose of this is to eliminate the unused discover icon on the panel.
